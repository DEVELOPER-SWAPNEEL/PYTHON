1. SYNTAX error:-> syntax should be in correct format
2. INDENTATION ERROR:-> proper indentations should be provided
3. ZERO DIVISION ERROR:-> any real number divided with 0 will give zero division error
4. MODULE ERROR:->  proper module name should be provided during import as well as during calling 
                    for Eg: import math 
                            print(math.pi) will give 3.14.....
                            but import mathmatics will give no such module present...
5.TYPE ERROR:-> if two different types of datatype are provided for a operation then it may or maynot support the operation..
6.LOGIC ERROR:-> if there is fault in the logic it may be as:
                    eg: a=2
                        b=2
                        print(a*b)-----> output:4
                        #but if we are provided with a+b in place of a*b then there will be an logic error but the outcome remained same for the timebeing..
                        #that's why multiple cases are considered for checking a proper code..
